// Mini Challenge 1 Endpoint MVC

// Brief Description: Design an API endpoint that receives user input and outputs a personalized greeting, such as "Hello, {user's name}." 
 
// Peer Reviewed By:  Aaron Perez - The Endpoit works as expected with a contoller folder. User can enter name and the output will say hello "Username". Good Job.
